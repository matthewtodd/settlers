- build.xml file added for Ant builds
- soc.util.Version class added so both build files and source code get
  version and copyright info from build.xml. Clients and server updated
- Build process creates two jar files: one for client, one for server
- README updated for jar file invocation, with additional sections for
  intro, requirements, hosting a server, and development
- Fix for inconsistent game state when players leave a game.
- Divider in chat window cannot be moved off-screen

  thread.

  within jar.
