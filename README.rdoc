= settlers

Play Settlers of Catan on your computer. You know you want to.

All the hard work here was part of Robb Thomas'
JSettlers[http://jsettlers.sf.net] project; I just wrapped his code with a
handy shell script.

== Behold

 settlers            # launches a game -- a server and a client connected to it

 settlers --client   # browses for a server to connect to

== Install

 gem install settlers
