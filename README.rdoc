= Settlers

Play Settlers of Catan on your computer. You know you want to.

All the hard work here was part of Robb Thomas'
JSettlers[http://jsettlers.sf.net] project, and then the follow-on
JSettlers2[http://jsettlers2.sf.net]. I just wrapped all their code with a handy
shell script, adding basic Bonjour support.

== Behold

 settlers            # Launch, announce, and connect to a game server.
 settlers --client   # Discover and connect to a game server.

== Install

 gem install settlers
